# rimenrechnik.com / Римен Речник

Source code for rimenrechnik.com.
The site existed in various forms from 2010 to 2021.
It started as a university thesis and grew as a separate website for several years. 
I pulled the plug in mid-2021, because I didn't have the time to work on it.

# Requirements
* .NET Core 2.0 or later.
* PostgreSQL - tested with v10 and v14.
* A list of words and their stresses that can be imported to the PG database. Thanks to [Читанка](https://rechnik.chitanka.info/about) for their efforts in compiling one. Go support them.
